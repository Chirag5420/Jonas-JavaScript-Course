    What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)? 
    - OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects; 
    - We use objects to model (describe) real-world or abstract features;
    - Objects may contain data (properties) and code (methods). By using objects, we pack data and the corresponding behaviour into one block;
    - In OOP, objects are self-contained pieces/blocks of code;
    - Objects are building blocks of applications, and interact with one another;
    - Interactions happen through a public interface (API): methods that the code outside of the object can access and use to communicate with the object;
    - OOP was developed with the goal of organizing code, to make it more flexible and easier to maintain (avoid "spaghetti code")

    Classes and Instances (Traditional OOP)
    - Class is a blueprint which can then be used to create new objects based on the rules described in the class. 
    - An instance is a real object that we can use in our code, which was created from a class and a class itself is not an object. 

    Four Fundamental Principles of OOP
    - Abstraction
      - Ignoring or hiding details that don't matter, allowing us to get an overview perspective of the thing we're implementing, instead of messing with details that don't really matter to our implementation;
    - Encapsulation
      - Keeping properties and methods private inside the class, so they are not accessible from outside the class. Some methods can be exposed as a public interface (API);
      - Why?
        - Prevents external code from accidentally manipulating internal properties / state
        - Allows to change internal implementation without the risk of breaking external code
    - Inheritance
      - Making all properties and methods of a certain class available to a child class, forming a hierarchical relationship between classes. This allow us to reuse common logic and to model real-world relationships. 
    - Polymorphism
      - A child class can overwrite a method it inherited from a parent class [it's more complex than that, but enough for our purposes].

// OOP in JavaScript 
/*
  - Objects (instances) are instantiated from a class, which functions like a blueprint;
  - The process of creating actual objects (instances) from theoretical class is called instantiation.
  
  - In JavaScript, we have something called prototypes and all objects in JS are linked to a certain prototype;
  - Each object has a prototype;
  - The prototype object contains methods and properties that all the objects that are linked to that prototype can access and use. This behaviour is usually called prototypal inheritance.
  - Prototypal inheritance: The prototype contains methods (behaviour) that are accessible to all objects linked to that prototype;
  - Objects inherit methods and properties from the prototype which is the reason why this mechanism is called prototypal inheritance;
  - Behaviour is delegated to the linked prototype object;

  3 Ways of Implementing Prototypal Inheritance in JavaScript
  - Constructor Functions
    - Technique to create objects from a function;
    - This is how built-in objects like Arrays, Maps or Sets are actually implemented.
  - ES6 Classes
    - Modern alternative to constructor function syntax;
    - "Syntactic sugar": behind the scenes, ES6 classes work exactly like constructor functions;
    - ES6 classes do NOT behave like classes in "classical OOP" (last lecture)
  - Object.create()
    - The easiest and most straightforward way of linking an object to a prototype object;
*/

// Constructor Functions and the new Operator

// The only difference between a regular function and constructor function is that we call the constructor function with the new operator

// In OOP, there is this convention that constructor function always start with a capital letter.
// NOTE: Arrow function would not work as a function constructor and that's because it does not have its own this keyword, so only function declarations and function expressions. 
const Person = function (firstName, birthYear) {
  // console.log(this); // We get an empty object as mentioned in point 2

  // Instance properties
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.birthYear = birthYear;

  // Never do this - Because let's say we create thousands or tens of thousands of objects from this constructor function. Then what would happen is that each of those objects would carry around this calcAge function and it would be terrible for the performance of our code. But in order to solve this problem we would make use of prototypes and prototypal inheritance.

  // this.calcAge = function(){
  //   console.log(2037 - birthYear);
  // }
}

/*
  The new operator is a very special operator and the following happen when we call a function with the new operator like this:
  1. New {} is created
  2. function is called, this = {}
  3. {} linked to prototype
  4. function automatically returns {}
*/
const jonas = new Person('Jonas', 1991);
console.log(jonas);

const matilda = new Person('Matilda', 2017);
const jack = new Person('Jack', 1975);
console.log(matilda, jack);

const jay = 'Jay';

console.log(jonas instanceof Person); // true
console.log(jay instanceof Person); // false

// Static methods
Person.hey = function(){
  console.log('Hey there üëãüèª');
  console.log(this); // Would be the entire Person constructor because that is the rule, whatever object is calling the method will be the this keyword inside of that function. So here this keyword, is simply that entire constructor function.
}

Person.hey();
// jonas.hey(); // TypeError jonas.hey is not a function (This occurs because it is simply not there in the prototype of the Jonas object. So there is no way, the Jonas object could inherit it) 

// Prototypes
/*
  First each and every function in JavaScript automatically has a property called prototype. And that includes of course, constructor functions. Now every object that is created by a certain constructor function will get access to all the methods and properties that we define on the constructors prototype property. 
*/

Person.prototype.calcAge = function(){
  console.log(2037 - this.birthYear);
}

jonas.calcAge();
matilda.calcAge();

// The Step Number 3 of linking object to prototype is what creates this property __proto__ and sets it to the Prototype property of the constructor function that is being called 
console.log(jonas.__proto__);
console.log(jonas.__proto__ === Person.prototype);

console.log(Person.prototype.isPrototypeOf(jonas)); // true
console.log(Person.prototype.isPrototypeOf(matilda)); // true
console.log(Person.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Person)); // false

// Setting properties on the Prototype 
Person.prototype.species = 'Homo Sapiens';

// NOTE: The species property would not be directly visible but instead visible inside the __proto__ property
console.log(jonas);
console.log(matilda);

// So own properties are only the ones that are directly declared on the object 
console.log(jonas.hasOwnProperty('firstName')); // true
console.log(jonas.hasOwnProperty('species')); // false (since it only has access to this attribute because of Person.prototype)

// Prototypal Inheritance and The Prototype Chain 
/*
  Everything starts with the Person constructor function. The constructor function has a prototype property which is an object and inside that object we defined the calcAge method. 

  So Person.prototype.constructor is going to point back to the original Person Constructor Function itself.

  NOTE: Person.prototype is not the prototype of Person, but the prototype of all the objects created by Person. 

  When we call a function with the new operator, 
  1. A new empty object is created instantly
  2. this keyword in construtor function call is set to the new object 
  3. The new object is linked (__proto__ property) to the constructor function's prototype property 
  4. The new object is automatically returned from the constructor function call

  Why is this so powerful?
  - The reason why prototypal inheritance / delegation is very useful in this example is because, now the calcAge function would be inherited by all the Person objects without the method being directly attached to all the objects themselves. This is essential for code performance. Because imagine, if we had a 1000 objects and all of them carried the calcAge function with them around it would certainly impact performance. So instead they all can simply use the calcAge function from their common prototype. 

  Prototype chain - Now the fact that Jonas object is connected to a prototype and the ability of looking up methods and properties in a prototype is what we call the prototype chain. So the jonas object and its prototype basically form a prototype chain. 

  But the prototype chain doesn't end here! Every object in JavaScript has a prototype. So Person.prototype itself must also have a prototype.
  And the prototype of Person.prototype is Object.prototype 

  Person.prototype is just a simple object which means that it has been built by the built-in object constructor function. And this is the function which is automatically called when we write an object literal.

  Now this entire series of links between the objects is what is called the prototype chain and object.prototype is usually the top which means its prototype (__proto__) is null, which then marks the end of the prototype chain.

// Prototypal Inheritance on Built-In Objects 
console.log(jonas.__proto__); // Person.prototype
console.log(jonas.__proto__.__proto__); // Object.prototype (top of prototype chain)
console.log(jonas.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__); // null

console.dir(Person.prototype.constructor); // Person Constructor Function

const arr = [3, 6, 6, 5, 6, 9, 9];
console.log(arr.__proto__); 
console.log(arr.__proto__ === Array.prototype); // true

// Since we know that all arrays inherit the methods from Array.prototype; We can use this knowledge to further extend the functionality of arrays.

Array.prototype.unique = function () {
  return [...new Set(this)];
};

console.log(arr.unique());

// NOTE: We should not include methods on built-in objects for two reasons:
// - Probably JS might add a function with the same name but a different functionality in its next release and then its going to break our code
// - Secondly, if we are working with a team of developers then multiple developers might create the same functionality with different names and its going to cause a lot of bugs.

// Encapsulation: Protected Properties and Methods

  Two reasons why we need Data Encapsulation and Data Privacy:
  - First, it is to prevent code from outside of a class to accidentally manipulate our data inside the class
  - Secondly, this also the reason we implement a public interface. So we are not supposed to manually mess with a property and therefore we should encapsulate it.
